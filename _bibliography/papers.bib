   abstract = {The optimization problems on real-world usually have non-linear characteristics. Solving non-linear problems is time-consuming, thus heuristic approaches usually are being used to speed up the solution’s searching. Among of the heuristic-based algorithms, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Simulated Annealing (SA) are two among most popular. The GA is powerful to get a nearly optimal solution on the broad searching area while SA is useful to looking for a solution in the narrow searching area. This study is comparing performance between GA, SA, and three types of Hybrid GA-SA to solve some non-linear optimization cases. The study shows that Hybrid GA-SA can enhance GA and SA to provide a better result},

   abstract = {Phrase table combination in pivot approaches can be an effective method to deal with low-resource language pairs. The common practice to generate phrase tables in pivot approaches is to use standard symmetrization, i.e., grow-diag-final-and. Although some researchers found that the use of non-standard symmetrization could improve bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) scores, the use of non-standard symmetrization has not been commonly employed in pivot approaches. In this study, we propose a strategy that uses the non-standard symmetrization of word alignment in phrase table combination. The appropriate symmetrization is selected based on the highest BLEU scores in each direct translation of source–target, source–pivot, and pivot–target of Kazakh–English (Kk–En) and Japanese–Indonesian (Ja–Id). Our experiments show that our proposed strategy outperforms the direct translation in Kk–En with absolute improvements of 0.35 (a 11.3% relative improvement) and 0.22 (a 6.4% relative improvement) BLEU points for 3-gram and 5-gram, respectively. The proposed strategy shows an absolute gain of up to 0.11 (a 0.9% relative improvement) BLEU points compared to direct translation for 3-gram in Ja–Id. Our proposed strategy using a small phrase table obtains better BLEU scores than a strategy using a large phrase table. The size of the target monolingual and feature function weight of the language model (LM) could reduce perplexity scores.},

abstract = {The aim of the Deep Research for Akkon project is to use machine-learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to analyze the large corpus of archaeological pottery fragments belonging to the Late Jomon period (ca. 4000 to 3200 aBP) in a non-invasive and non-destructive manner. In Japan, recent research conducted by using the ”impression method” revealed that ceramic vessels belonging to that era contain impressions of plant seeds. Studying these impressions allows archaeologists to better understand the cultural practices of the Jomon people and the path of rice diffusion in Japan. Most of the analysis was conducted by visually inspecting X-ray images. However, results based on using only X-rays are often inconclusive, leading researchers to use other invasive techniques that damage the potsherds. In this paper, we present a method that classifies X-ray images of potsherds by using deep learning. A dataset composed of 1036 images with seven classes was used to evaluate our approach. We generated different models using different CNN architectures and parameters and analyzed them separately. Then, we applied techniques such as ensemble and test-time augmentation to evaluate how such techniques impact our model. The best result was obtained by combining EfficientNetB7 trained with different parameters, achieving a classification rate of 90%.},

For different weight of beef cattle, the required nutrition is also different. The feed also requires a balance of nutrients with a low price. This paper presents a comparison of four types of Evolution Strategies (ES) for beef cattle feed optimization. The results of our experiments suggest that the performance and robustness of ES (µ,λ), ES (µ/ρ,λ), and ES (µ+λ) are comparable, while ES (µ/ρ+λ) performs slightly worse. This fact together promotes ES (µ/ρ,λ) as the most robust for practical use. The experimental results show that the feed price obtained from ES (µ/ρ,λ) is 5524.465 with fitness value of 1.809861462.}, number={1-8}, journal={Journal of Telecommunication, Electronic and Computer Engineering (JTEC)}, author={Fatyanosa, Tirana Noor and Mahmudy, Wayan Firdaus and Marjuki, Marjuki}, year={2018}, month={Feb.}, pages={165–171},

Minimize expenses without ruling out the nutrients needed by the cattle is necessary. This study uses Evolution Strategies (ES) to optimize the beef cattle feed. However, the performance of the conventional ES takes a long time to obtain the optimal solution. This may be caused by an error in initial population which is a significant assignment in evolutionary algorithms since it can influence the convergence speed and the final solution quality. Random initialization is the most commonly utilized strategy to initialize the population. This paper proposes a novel initialization approach which utilizes Linear Programming (LP) to produce initial population. The experiments show that the ES (µ/r+) with LP surpassed the LP and ES (µ/r+). The fitness value obtained from ES (µ/r+) with LP was 13.12156 and the price was 763.8331 with zero penalties. The proposed method produce the highest fitness value with the lowest price and the lowest penalty, thus prove the usefulness of LP as the initial population of ES.}, number={1-4}, journal={Journal of Telecommunication, Electronic and Computer Engineering (JTEC)}, author={Fatyanosa, Tirana Noor and Utaminingrum, Fitri and Data, Mahendra}, year={2018}, month={Jan.}, pages={153–158},
